* TODO - various tasks which need to be worked on

When you work on this and finished an item, make sure to
point it out in this file.

** */*

- Update to EAPI 6.

** net-misc/gnunet

- _!Fix the postinst message!_
- Last dependency checks
- Debug the openrc service and improve it to function like intended
  (see post setup notes). Either fix the service or adjust the ebuild.
*** ng0
  I think the service is fixed now, we need to make it customizable and
  then we can include it in gnunet source.

** net-p2p/retroshare

- Check if we are affected by the annual sourceforge stupidity of changing
  URLs of download locations.

** sys-apps/guix

- Debug the openrc service!
- Check the ebuild for mistakes.
- Update to 0.11 [done]

** sys-apps/guix-bin

- Make it functional.

** www-plugins/*

- Fix this: use() is wrong in the ebuilds.

** dev-perl/Net-PSYC

- fix the last minor problems in Makefile and/or expand it -> ng0 will do it.
- psycion segfaults when torified. debug this.

** www-client/palemoon

- patch it to remove default start page (which contains advertisment)
- write an update fetcher - its home page is behind the Great Firewall of Cloudflare
** www-client/torbrowser-bundle

- we do not actually use this or have tested
  this. for maintenance ease we should drop
  it.
