# Thanks to ng0 for writing this initial ebuild stub.
#
# The main reason to want to install Nix on Gentoo is to have a
# source of trustworthy reproducible binaries so we don't have
# to build every binary ourselves in order to be able to trust
# our system. Ideal to avoid having to compile torbrowser, which
# is supposed to be reproducible.
#
# Well, here's some bad news: Nix apparently makes a distinction
# between "reproducible" and "deterministic" according to the only
# wiki page that mentions the terms:
#
#		https://nixos.org/wiki/GSOC_2015_ideas_list
#
# So far we have not found out which packages from the NixOS store
# are trustworthy, let alone how to get a cryptographic proof.
