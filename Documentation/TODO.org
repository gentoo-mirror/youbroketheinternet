point it out in this file.

** */*

- Update to EAPI 6.

** net-misc/gnunet

- _!Fix the postinst message!_
- Last dependency checks
- Debug the openrc service and improve it to function like intended
  (see post setup notes). Either fix the service or adjust the ebuild.
*** ng0
  I think the service is fixed now, we need to make it customizable and
  then we can include it in gnunet source.

** DONE net-p2p/retroshare

- Check if we are affected by the annual sourceforge stupidity of changing
  URLs of download locations.

*** ng0
I don't use it, won't fix it. Marking it as DONE as in WONTFIX.

** sys-apps/guix

*** Debug the openrc service!
*** Check the ebuild for mistakes.
*** DONE Update to 0.11 [done]

** sys-apps/guix-bin

- Make it functional.

** sys-apps/nix

- Add a service.
- Debug it.

** www-plugins/*

- Fix this: use() is wrong in the ebuilds.

** dev-perl/Net-PSYC

*** fix the last minor problems in Makefile and/or expand it -> ng0 will do it.
*** DONE psycion segfaults when torified. debug this.

** www-client/palemoon

- patch it to remove default start page (which contains advertisment)
- write an update fetcher - its home page is behind the Great Firewall of Cloudflare
