psyced is a multi-protocol chat and messaging daemon that federates
over XMPP and PSYC while accepting IRC, PSYC and XMPP clients.
Compared to regular IRC servers it comes with programmable channels
which make bots unnecessary, it comes with authenticated users and
persistency of conversations, making IRC services and bouncers
unnecessary. By disallowing the /mode feature of IRC it reduces the
risk of channel warfare. It also provides a built-in HTTP server
and many other experimental features such as NNTP, RSS, WAP.
