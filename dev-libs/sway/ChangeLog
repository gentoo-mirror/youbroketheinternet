  15 May 2016; Ian Delaney <idella4@gentoo.org> sway-0.6.ebuild,
  sway-9999.ebuild:
  enable important USE flags by default.

  According to upstream, these options are considered core
  functionality, and are recommended to be enabled by default.

  Disabling them results in a very minimal build; probably
  not what most users would want, or expect.
