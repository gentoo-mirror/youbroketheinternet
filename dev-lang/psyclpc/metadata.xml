    psyclpc is a programming language for intense multi-user network applications
    such as psyced. it's a fork of LDMud with some features and many bug fixes.
    We kept it compatible to LDMud, so you can run a MUD with it, too.
    It is available from http://lpc.psyc.eu.

    LDMud itself is a continuation of the Amylaar LPMud Gamedriver 3.1.2.
    See also http://www.bearnip.com/lars/proj/ldmud.html.

    psyclpc is released under the GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 2.
